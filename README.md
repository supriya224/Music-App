# Project Title

This project has been an enriching experience for me, and I've learned a great deal during its completion. While it's fully functional on my local computer, I've encountered some issues after deployment. I've provided a snapshot of the project below to highlight the current state.

I'm actively working to resolve these issues and improve the project's functionality. I'll update this repository as soon as I make progress and address the errors.
